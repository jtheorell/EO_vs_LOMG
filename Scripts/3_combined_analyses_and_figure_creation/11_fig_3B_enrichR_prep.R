#I took the files with the up- and downregulated gene lists for EOMGlow and LOMGlow generated 
#in script 10_fig_3A_heatmaps_on_selected_markers, and uploaded them below:

#These were then added to https://maayanlab.cloud/enrichr-kg and analysed there
#the 30th of August 2024. 
#Resulting images and lists were downloaded and put in Results/Graphics/Enrichr-KG. 

#post-hoc, I excluded the 2021-KEGG_Human Data, as it did not add anything
#meaningful. 
#I put the plots in Results/Graphics/Stockholm
